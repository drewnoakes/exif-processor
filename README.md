# exif-processor

A lightweight wrapper around the exif-processing functionality of 
[metadata-extractor](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor).

## Installation

The 2.7.0 branch of metadata-extractor is required, as it fixes a bug
in processing streams. To install it:

```bash
$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/metadata-extractor/
$ cd metadata-extractor
$ mvn install
```

If you find that the build process from `mvn install` is failing because some of the tests are not passing, try this instead:

```bash
$ mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install
```

## Usage

```clojure
user> (use 'exif-processor.core)
user> (exif-for-url "http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7320/8747460606_96250e211e_b.jpg")
